## AWS restart
AWS re/Start is a free, cohort-based training program that helps unemployed or underemployed individuals start cloud careers, even without a tech background. It partners with organizations that support underrepresented and vulnerable groups. Through hands-on labs and real-world scenarios, learners gain technical skills for entry- to mid-level cloud roles, along with professional development training such as résumé building and interview preparation.
